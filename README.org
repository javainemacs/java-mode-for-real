* CONCEPT

  Our goal is to make an Emacs mode to edit in Java using only Elisp.

* REASONABLE IDEAS

- [ ] Derivate project from java-mode. ([[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Derived-Modes.html#Derived-Modes][How to derive from a major mode]])
- [ ] An auxiliar archive in the project folder to list used JARs, in order to create directly our classpath.
- [ ] The java library preloaded?
- [ ] "jar tf <path.jar>" to get all classes and packages
- [ ] "javap -cp <path.jar> package.to.Class" to get all the functions of the class
- [ ] "javac -cp pathjar1;pathjar2 Main.java" to compile? http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/j9c_packageclasspath.html
- [ ] "java -cp .;pathjar1;pathjar2 Main" to execute?
- [ ] Once we have all the knowdledge, autocomplete ^^

* NOT-SO-REASONABLE IDEAS (now)

  - Create a tree with all project classes, showing relations and types of each one.
  - Debugger.
  - A Java flycheck-like mode.
